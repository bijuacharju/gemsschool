children good\r\n            education in English Medium had to opt for some of the hill stations\r\n            in India. Before winter started, most such parents and guardians\r\n            were found heading towards these stations to bring their children\r\n            home for Winter vacation, and this too, after depositing a lot of\r\n            money there.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            With a view to reducing the flow of Nepalese revenue outside, some\r\n            farsighted Nepalese citizens came up with a proposal of establishing\r\n            English medium schools within the country to impart quality\r\n            education to Nepalese students. In the year 2038 B.S., under the\r\n            initiative of Mr. Rajesh Khadka, Mr. Gopal Kumar Basnet, Mr. Sudhir\r\n            Siwakoti and Mr. Dinesh Malla, Little Flowers' English School came\r\n            into being in the then hamlet of Birtamode in Jhapa with a total\r\n            number of 47 students and 4 teachers ranging from classes Nursery to\r\n            Grade II. Now, Little Flowers' English School is a full-fledged\r\n            Higher Secondary School catering to more than 1800 students and is,\r\n            perhaps, the only school with all the required infrastructure in the\r\n            Eastern Development Region.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <div className=\"imageHolder\">\r\n          <Row>\r\n            <Col xs={12} md={12}>\r\n              <Card>\r\n                <Card.Img src={Kiranbhawan} />\r\n              </Card>\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </Row>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Inspired by the success of Little Flowers' English School and\r\n            encouraged by eminent educationists in Kathmandu, Graded English\r\n            Medium School (GEMS) was established by Mr. Rajesh Khadka, one of\r\n            the pioneers of LFES, in the year 2041 in a rented house at Sanepa\r\n            Height in Lalitpur with a total of 78 students, and 18 teachers\r\n            teaching from Nursery to Grade III. A few years later, the school\r\n            expanded and was also housed in Kiran Bhawan. As a result of the\r\n            sense of commitment and untiring effort of the management, the\r\n            devotion of the staff-teaching or non-teaching and the continued\r\n            support of guardians, 'GEMS' proudly stands aloft at Dhapakhel in a\r\n            harmonious educational environment with educational programmes\r\n            unequalled by other institutions and can proudly boast of having\r\n            almost all the infrastructure required by an educational institution\r\n            in level with international standard. The Primary Wing and the\r\n            Primary hostel are still housed at Kiran Bhawan in Sanepa. At this\r\n            juncture, it would be totally unfair to ignore the valuable\r\n            contributions of academic pillars like late Mr. Parsuram Roka, who\r\n            served in the capacity of Principal for nearly a decade. To him, our\r\n            salutations !\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            In an institution like 'GEMS', having a long history, entry and exit\r\n            of employees is common and unavoidable. However, there are employees\r\n            who have remained with the institution right since the time of its\r\n            establishment. We feel grieved to state that many have left for\r\n            their heavenly abode. May their souls rest in peace. Undoubtedly,\r\n            their service has been of great value to 'GEMS'. Currently, there\r\n            are 251 members of teaching, 49 non-teaching, 38 administrative and\r\n            138 supporting staff making to a total of 476 employees. Hence,\r\n            'GEMS' can rightly claim to be an agent to minimize the problem of\r\n            unemployment, too.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            12 students appeared for the S.L.C. examinations for the first time\r\n            in 2050 B.S. and, ever since, 100% results with outstanding marks\r\n            has been a hallmark of 'GEMS'. Till date, a total of 1814 students\r\n            have graduated from 'GEMS' with 328 achieving distinction, 1224\r\n            First Division and the rest Second Division. Master Kundan Nepal was\r\n            placed Board 6th in 2051 whereas Master Umesh Thapa emerged Board\r\n            9th in 2052. Similarly, Master Sugat Ratna Kansakar was placed Board\r\n            7th in the year 2059. In the S.L.C. results of 2059, Miss Sunita\r\n            Yadav was the national topper while Miss Sushila Khadka was third\r\n            among the girls. 260 students are appearing for the forthcoming\r\n            S.L.C. Examinations. It also makes us proud to state that 'GEMS'\r\n            came up with the best results in S.L.C. for two consecutive years,\r\n            2058 and 2059 B.S. and was honoured as the best school in the\r\n            country, and awarded the Birendra National Shield, the National Flag\r\n            and a cash prize of Rs. 1,00,000/- on both these occasions. Students\r\n            of 'GEMS' have excelled in academics in the international level,\r\n            too. To cite some examples, Master Ujjwal Raut, an ex-student of the\r\n            school was decorated with the Presidential Award in Luther College,\r\n            Decorah, Iowa, USA for excellent performance in the year 1997. He\r\n            completed his Ph.D. in Space Science Engineering from Verginia\r\n            University in 2009 and is currently employed in the same University.\r\n            Master Pramod Khadka also completed Ph.D. in Economics from George\r\n            Town University in Washington D.C., USA, in 2009 and is currently\r\n            teaching at Ajou University in South Korea. Having completed Ph.D.\r\n            in Electrical Sciences and Computer Engineering, Master Kundan Nepal\r\n            is an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at\r\n            Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, USA teaching Masters Level\r\n            Courses in Computer Architecture in Integrated Circuit Design. He is\r\n            a recipient of nearly a dozen awards and fellowships.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            'GEMS' believes that and extra- curricular activities are also an\r\n            integral part of school education that encourages students to excel\r\n            in these fields, too. 'GEMS' was honoured with the Championship\r\n            Trophy as the winner of the International School Level Judo\r\n            Championship in the year 1997, and was awarded the First\r\n            International Judo Championship Trophy jointly by the then Princess\r\n            Shruti and the former Prime Minister of Japan, Hashimoto. 'GEMS' has\r\n            continuously been the winner of the Inter-School Gymnastic\r\n            Championship which was a nationwide event. It successffully staged\r\n            the opera 'Balak Dhruva' in Copenhegan (Denmark) in the year 1996 in\r\n            the 5th World Festival of Children's Theatre organized by the\r\n            International Amateur Theatre Association (IATA) and exposed Nepali\r\n            culture to the international arena. In 1998, 'GEMS' was granted an\r\n            affiliate membership of IATA with the Asian Regional Centre in\r\n            Toyoma, Japan. Two years later, the 'Kumari Ballet' was staged\r\n            during the 6th World Festival of Children's Theatre by 17 students\r\n            of students of 'GEMS' in Toyoma, Japan. Again, at the Asia Pacific\r\n            Festival the Opera 'Chandalika' was staged by 10 students in Toyoma\r\n            Japan in 2004. In 2007, 3 students participated in the Judo\r\n            Championship organized by Matsumoto Municipality in Japan. The same\r\n            year 6 members of the GEMS Scouts had the opportunity of\r\n            participating in the 21st World Scout Jamboree at Hylands Park,\r\n            Chelmsford in the U.K. Similarly 23 scouts participated in the scout\r\n            Jamboree at Kolkata in India the same year. The school has plans of\r\n            conducting more programmes abroad in the near future.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Morality is yet another quality that enhances the discipline in\r\n            students. Hence, time and again, prominent personnel have been\r\n            invited to talk to the students and inculcate in them, lessons of\r\n            moral values. Acharya Pravar Shree Gulab Ji Maharaj was at 'GEMS'\r\n            for a discourse on Self Development Skill on 19th March 1999.\r\n            Similarly, Dr. Art Yong Jumsai, a NASA scientist and advisor along\r\n            with Sister Angelia Loraine Borrows, a prominent educationist were\r\n            with the students to launch a training on Education in Human Values\r\n            in 2005. Now, not only has 'GEMS' become a full-fledged high School\r\n            with more than 3500 students from Class I to X, but has also been\r\n            successfully conducting GCE 'A' Level and Plus 2 programme in\r\n            Science since June 2008. Besides, American Modeled Medical Degree\r\n            BSMD (Bachelor of Science leading to Doctor of Medicine) programme\r\n            equivalent to MBBS under the affiliation with Angeles University\r\n            Foundation (AUF) of the Philippines has also been launched since\r\n            July 2008. The first batch of 18 students from 'GEMS' left for the\r\n            Philippines in September 2009 to complete their medical degree\r\n            there, and another second batch of 22 students are undergoing their\r\n            studies here, and will soon be leaving.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Today, the whole nation is disturbed, more so the education field,\r\n            especially the private sector. In such a condition, the effort of\r\n            the school and its management alone will not be sufficient for the\r\n            continuity and prosperity of any institution. It is not that the\r\n            school has not got support from the different sectors of the\r\n            society. The fact is that more support and participation is\r\n            imperative in the forthcoming days. Hence, the 'GEMS' family appeals\r\n            to all guardians, well wishers, journalists, academic personalities,\r\n            industrialists, businessmen and the nation as a whole to extend\r\n            their fullest co-operation to make 'GEMS' shine like 'gems' and lead\r\n            the nation from darkness towards light, 'LEAD KINDLY LIGHT'.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default History;\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\n\r\nfunction Pedagogy() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"container-fluid block\">\r\n      <div className=\"container\">\r\n        <div className=\"titleHolder\">\r\n          <h2>Learning Pedagogy</h2>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"contentHolder\">\r\n          <p>\r\n            At GEMS, we provide students with a stimulating learning\r\n            environment, in which they explore their full potential and develop\r\n            a strong academic foundation for higher studies. A child-centred\r\n            teaching approach has been adopted in the primary level that has\r\n            considerably helped children in their intellectual, emotional and\r\n            social development.

A training programme for the\r\n            teachers has already been started for the effective implementation\r\n            of this approach in the future.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            In the child-centered teaching approach, the teacher acts as a\r\n            facilitator for learning and much emphasis is given to the needs,\r\n            interest and ability of the students while teaching for their\r\n            holistic development. A wide range of classroom activities are\r\n            conducted for them to gain hands-on learning experience. In higher\r\n            classes, however, more emphasis is given to academic learning as a\r\n            preparation for the board examinations.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Pedagogy;\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\n\r\nfunction AcademicInformation() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"container-fluid block\"  id=\"academicInformation\">\r\n      <div className=\"container\">\r\n        <div className=\"titleHolder\">\r\n          <h2>Academic Information</h2>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"contentHolder\">\r\n          <p>\r\n            The academic session begins in mid-April (the first week of\r\n            Baisakh), and is completed by the second week of March of the\r\n            following year (the first week of Chaitra).
