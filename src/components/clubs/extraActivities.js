            'A healthy mind in a healthy body' is an old adage. To develop a
            healthy mind in a healthy body, outdoor and indoor games are
            provided. Various co-curricular and extracurricular activities are
            conducted to allow the students to explore their talents and for
            their overall development. A separate ECA department, headed by an
            ECA In-charge with a team of instructors, looks after these
            activities. In addition, pursuits like creative writing, poetry
            recitations and writing of articles for the school magazine are
            encouraged. Public speaking in the form of debates and extempore
            speeches is also held regularly. Other activities such as
            Gymnastics, Judo, Tae-kwan-do, Wushu, music, dance, fabric painting,
            fine art, etc. enable students to discover their talents.
            Professional instructors of high stature are employed in each
            discipline to guide and train the students.
