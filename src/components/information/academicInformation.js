            The academic session begins in mid-April (the first week of
            Baisakh), and is completed by the second week of March of the
            following year (the first week of Chaitra). The academic session is
            divided into three terms, and each term ends with the conduct of the
            terminal examination. Unit tests account for ten (10) percent, and
            the terminal examinations carry 90 percent of the marks. The final
            result is prepared on the basis of average marks obtained throughout
            the three terms. Students, who fail for two consecutive years in the
            same class, will be issued a TC.
