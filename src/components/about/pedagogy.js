            At GEMS, we provide students with a stimulating learning
            environment, in which they explore their full potential and develop
            a strong academic foundation for higher studies. A child-centred
            teaching approach has been adopted in the primary level that has
            considerably helped children in their intellectual, emotional and
            social development. Plans are afoot to gradually implement the same
            in higher grades in the years ahead. A training programme for the
            teachers has already been started for the effective implementation
            of this approach in the future.

            In the child-centered teaching approach, the teacher acts as a
            facilitator for learning and much emphasis is given to the needs,
            interest and ability of the students while teaching for their
            holistic development. A wide range of classroom activities are
            conducted for them to gain hands-on learning experience. In higher
            classes, however, more emphasis is given to academic learning as a
            preparation for the board examinations.
