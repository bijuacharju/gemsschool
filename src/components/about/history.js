            About three decades ago, parents eager to give their children good
            education in English Medium had to opt for some of the hill stations
            in India. Before winter started, most such parents and guardians
            were found heading towards these stations to bring their children
            home for Winter vacation, and this too, after depositing a lot of
            money there.

            With a view to reducing the flow of Nepalese revenue outside, some
            farsighted Nepalese citizens came up with a proposal of establishing
            English medium schools within the country to impart quality
            education to Nepalese students. In the year 2038 B.S., under the
            initiative of Mr. Rajesh Khadka, Mr. Gopal Kumar Basnet, Mr. Sudhir
            Siwakoti and Mr. Dinesh Malla, Little Flowers' English School came
            into being in the then hamlet of Birtamode in Jhapa with a total
            number of 47 students and 4 teachers ranging from classes Nursery to
            Grade II. Now, Little Flowers' English School is a full-fledged
            Higher Secondary School catering to more than 1800 students and is,
            perhaps, the only school with all the required infrastructure in the
            Eastern Development Region.

            Inspired by the success of Little Flowers' English School and
            encouraged by eminent educationists in Kathmandu, Graded English
            Medium School (GEMS) was established by Mr. Rajesh Khadka, one of
            the pioneers of LFES, in the year 2041 in a rented house at Sanepa
            Height in Lalitpur with a total of 78 students, and 18 teachers
            teaching from Nursery to Grade III. A few years later, the school
            expanded and was also housed in Kiran Bhawan. As a result of the
            sense of commitment and untiring effort of the management, the
            devotion of the staff-teaching or non-teaching and the continued
            support of guardians, 'GEMS' proudly stands aloft at Dhapakhel in a
            harmonious educational environment with educational programmes
            unequalled by other institutions and can proudly boast of having
            almost all the infrastructure required by an educational institution
            in level with international standard. The Primary Wing and the
            Primary hostel are still housed at Kiran Bhawan in Sanepa. At this
            juncture, it would be totally unfair to ignore the valuable
            contributions of academic pillars like late Mr. Parsuram Roka, who
            served in the capacity of Principal for nearly a decade. To him, our
            salutations !
          </p>
          <p>
            In an institution like 'GEMS', having a long history, entry and exit
            of employees is common and unavoidable. However, there are employees
            who have remained with the institution right since the time of its
            establishment. We feel grieved to state that many have left for
            their heavenly abode. May their souls rest in peace. Undoubtedly,
            their service has been of great value to 'GEMS'. Currently, there
            are 251 members of teaching, 49 non-teaching, 38 administrative and
            138 supporting staff making to a total of 476 employees. Hence,
            'GEMS' can rightly claim to be an agent to minimize the problem of
            unemployment, too.

            12 students appeared for the S.L.C. examinations for the first time
            in 2050 B.S. and, ever since, 100% results with outstanding marks
            has been a hallmark of 'GEMS'. Till date, a total of 1814 students
            have graduated from 'GEMS' with 328 achieving distinction, 1224
            First Division and the rest Second Division. Master Kundan Nepal was
            placed Board 6th in 2051 whereas Master Umesh Thapa emerged Board
            9th in 2052. Similarly, Master Sugat Ratna Kansakar was placed Board

            Yadav was the national topper while Miss Sushila Khadka was third
            among the girls. 260 students are appearing for the forthcoming
            S.L.C. Examinations. It also makes us proud to state that 'GEMS'
            came up with the best results in S.L.C. for two consecutive years,
            2058 and 2059 B.S. and was honoured as the best school in the
            country, and awarded the Birendra National Shield, the National Flag
            and a cash prize of Rs. 1,00,000/- on both these occasions. Students
            of 'GEMS' have excelled in academics in the international level,
            too. To cite some examples, Master Ujjwal Raut, an ex-student of the
            school was decorated with the Presidential Award in Luther College,
            Decorah, Iowa, USA for excellent performance in the year 1997. He
            completed his Ph.D. in Space Science Engineering from Verginia
            University in 2009 and is currently employed in the same University.
            Master Pramod Khadka also completed Ph.D. in Economics from George
            Town University in Washington D.C., USA, in 2009 and is currently
            teaching at Ajou University in South Korea. Having completed Ph.D.
            in Electrical Sciences and Computer Engineering, Master Kundan Nepal
            is an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at
            Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, USA teaching Masters Level
            Courses in Computer Architecture in Integrated Circuit Design. He is
            a recipient of nearly a dozen awards and fellowships.

            'GEMS' believes that and extra- curricular activities are also an
            integral part of school education that encourages students to excel
            in these fields, too. 'GEMS' was honoured with the Championship
            Trophy as the winner of the International School Level Judo
            Championship in the year 1997, and was awarded the First
            International Judo Championship Trophy jointly by the then Princess
            Shruti and the former Prime Minister of Japan, Hashimoto. 'GEMS' has
            continuously been the winner of the Inter-School Gymnastic
            Championship which was a nationwide event. It successffully staged
            the opera 'Balak Dhruva' in Copenhegan (Denmark) in the year 1996 in
            the 5th World Festival of Children's Theatre organized by the
            International Amateur Theatre Association (IATA) and exposed Nepali
            culture to the international arena. In 1998, 'GEMS' was granted an
            affiliate membership of IATA with the Asian Regional Centre in
            Toyoma, Japan. Two years later, the 'Kumari Ballet' was staged
            during the 6th World Festival of Children's Theatre by 17 students
            of students of 'GEMS' in Toyoma, Japan. Again, at the Asia Pacific
            Festival the Opera 'Chandalika' was staged by 10 students in Toyoma
            Japan in 2004. In 2007, 3 students participated in the Judo
            Championship organized by Matsumoto Municipality in Japan. The same
            year 6 members of the GEMS Scouts had the opportunity of
            participating in the 21st World Scout Jamboree at Hylands Park,
            Chelmsford in the U.K. Similarly 23 scouts participated in the scout
            Jamboree at Kolkata in India the same year. The school has plans of
            conducting more programmes abroad in the near future.

            Morality is yet another quality that enhances the discipline in
            students. Hence, time and again, prominent personnel have been
            invited to talk to the students and inculcate in them, lessons of
            moral values. Acharya Pravar Shree Gulab Ji Maharaj was at 'GEMS'
            for a discourse on Self Development Skill on 19th March 1999.
            Similarly, Dr. Art Yong Jumsai, a NASA scientist and advisor along
            with Sister Angelia Loraine Borrows, a prominent educationist were
            with the students to launch a training on Education in Human Values
            in 2005. Now, not only has 'GEMS' become a full-fledged high School
            with more than 3500 students from Class I to X, but has also been
            successfully conducting GCE 'A' Level and Plus 2 programme in
            Science since June 2008. Besides, American Modeled Medical Degree
            BSMD (Bachelor of Science leading to Doctor of Medicine) programme
            equivalent to MBBS under the affiliation with Angeles University
            Foundation (AUF) of the Philippines has also been launched since
            July 2008. The first batch of 18 students from 'GEMS' left for the
            Philippines in September 2009 to complete their medical degree
            there, and another second batch of 22 students are undergoing their
            studies here, and will soon be leaving.

            Today, the whole nation is disturbed, more so the education field,
            especially the private sector. In such a condition, the effort of
            the school and its management alone will not be sufficient for the
            continuity and prosperity of any institution. It is not that the
            school has not got support from the different sectors of the
            society. The fact is that more support and participation is
            imperative in the forthcoming days. Hence, the 'GEMS' family appeals
            to all guardians, well wishers, journalists, academic personalities,
            industrialists, businessmen and the nation as a whole to extend
            their fullest co-operation to make 'GEMS' shine like 'gems' and lead
            the nation from darkness towards light, 'LEAD KINDLY LIGHT'.
